'''The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must generate a matrix of
size RxC with zeroes, where R represents the number of rows N+I in the matrix and C
represents the number of columns (N*2)+1 in the matrix. The program must replace the
zeroes in the matrix based on the following conditions.
- All the zeroes in the first row are replaced with asterisks.
- All the zeroes in the middle column are replaced with asterisks.
- All the zeroes in the diagonal from top-left to the bottom-middle are replaced with asterisks.
- All the zeroes in the diagonal from top-right to the bottom-middle are replaced with
asterisks.
Finally, the program must print the modified matrix as the output.
Input:
4
Output:
