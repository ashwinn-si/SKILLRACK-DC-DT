/*The program must accept two string values P and S as input. The string P represents a pattern
The string S represents a set of words. The character in P matches any single character. The
program must print the word in S that matches the given pattern P as the output. If two or
more words match the pattern P, then the program must print the first occurring word as the
output.
Note; At least one word in S is always matched with P.

Input:
LION crane lion breath kiln

Output:
lion

Explanation:
Here P = and S = "LION crane lion breath kiln".
There are two words in S that match the pattern P.
lion klin
So the first occurring word lion is printed as the output.
