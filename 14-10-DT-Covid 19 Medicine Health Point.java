/*A new medicine for covid-19 is under testing on humans, The medicine must be tested on
humans for N days continuously. After taking the medicine on each day, it may increase or
decrease X health points of the person. The program must accept N integers representing the
changes in the health points of the person in N days. The program must print the minimum
health points that a person must have initially so that there is no negative health points
(including O) when testing the medicine for N days.

Input:
5
-2 3 4 1 -5

Output:
8

Explanation:
If the person has 8 health points initially,
ISt day -> The person's health is decreased by 2 points. Now the person has 6 health points.
2 day -Y The person's health is increased by 3 points. Now the person has 9 health points.
3rd day -Y The person's health is decreased by 4 points. Now the person has 5 health points.
4th day -> The person's health is increased by 1 point. Now the person has 6 health points.
5th day -> The person's health is decreased by 5 points. Now the person has 1 health point.
There is no negative health points (including O) when testing the medicine for 5 days.
