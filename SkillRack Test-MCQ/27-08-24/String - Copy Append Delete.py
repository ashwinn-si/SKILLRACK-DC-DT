'''The program must accept two string values Sl and S2 as the input. The string S2 contains only
the characters C, A and D. The program must modify the string Sl based on the characters
present in the string S2.
I) Copy (C) - Copy all the characters in the string Sl.
2) Append (A) - Append the characters which are copied last time.
3) Delete (D) - Delete the last character in the string Sl if at least two characters are present.
Finally, the program must print the modified string Sl as the output.
NQtÃŸ The first two characters of S2 are always C and A.
