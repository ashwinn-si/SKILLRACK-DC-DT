'''
The program must accept a string S and two integers R, C as the input. The program must
form a matrix of size RxC. Then the program must fill the matrix with the characters of S in
horizontal zig-zag direction. If some cells in the matrix are not filled in, the program must fill
those cells with asterisks.

Input:
environmentcareneeded

Output:
enviro
ctnemn
arenee
***ded

Explanation:
Here S = environmentcareneeded, R = 4 and C = 6.
The number of rows in the matrix must be 4.
The number of columns in the matrix must be 6.
After filling the matrix with the characters of S in horizontal zig-zag direction, the matrix
becomes
enviro
ctnemn
***ded
