/*The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print N triangles
numbered from I to N based on the following conditions.
- The triangle contains (290-1 lines.
- The ISt line contains the integer l.
- The 2nd line contains the integers from 2 to 1.
- The 3rd line contains the integers from 3 to 1. Similarly, the first X lines of the triangle are
printed.
- The (X+l)th line contains the integers from X-I to 1.
- The (X+2)th line contains the integers from X-2 to 1.
- The (X+3)th line contains the integers from X-3 to 1. Similarly, the remaining lines of the
triangle are printed.

Input:
3

Output:
