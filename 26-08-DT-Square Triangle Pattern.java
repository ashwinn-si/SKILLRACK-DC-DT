/*The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must generate a grid of size
RxC with the asterisks, where R represents the number of rows in the grid (N) and C represents
the number of columns in the grid ((2*N)-1). Then the program must generate a sequence of
integers with the squares of the integers l, 2, 3, 4, (3*N)-3. Then the program must modify
the grid by replacing the asterisks with the integers in the generated sequence based on the
following conditions.
- The asterisks present in the cells from the bottom-left to the top-middle must be replaced
with the first N integers in the generated sequence.
- Then the asterisks present in the cells from the top-middle (exclusive) to the bottom-right
must be replaced with the next (N-1) integers in the generated sequence.
- Then the asterisks present in the alternate cells from the bottom-right to the bottom-left
(both exclusive) must be replaced with the remaining integers in the generated sequence.
Finally, the program must print the RxC grid as the output.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3

Output:
**9**
*4*16*
1*36*25
