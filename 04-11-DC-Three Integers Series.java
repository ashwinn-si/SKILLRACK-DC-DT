- The 4th term will be sum of ISt and 2nd terms.
- The 5 term will be sum of 2nd and 3rd terms.
- The 6â‚¬1 term will be sum of 3rd and ISt terms.
- The 7th term will be sum of 4th and 5th terms.
- The 8th term will be sum of 5th and 6th terms.
- The 9 term will be sum of 6th and 4 terms and so on.
