'''The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the minimum
number Of characters M to be added in the string S so that a palindrome is formed using the
characters in the string S as the output
The string S is case sensitive.

Input:
RoaR

Output:
1
Explanation:
Here S = RoaR
If the character a or o is added to the string, the palindrome can be formed as given below.
or
so the count 1 is printed as the output.
