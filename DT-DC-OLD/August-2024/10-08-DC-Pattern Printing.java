/*The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the pattern which
contains N lines based on the following conditions.
In the first line, N integers are printed and the value starts from I and increments each value
by N, N-1, N-2 and so on.
In the second line, N-1 integers are printed and the value starts from 2 and increments each
value by N, N-1, N-2 and so on.
In the third line, N-2 integers are printed and the value starts from 3 and increments each
value by N, N-I, N-2 and so on.
Similarly, the remaining lines of the pattern are printed as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
3 N 50
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
Output Format:
The first N lines, each contains the integer value(s) based on the given conditions.
