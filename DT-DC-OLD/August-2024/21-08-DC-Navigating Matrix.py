'''The program must accept a character matrix of size RxC as the input. The program must
navigate the matrix from the top-left cell based on the following conditions.
- If there is an alphabet below the current cell, then navigate to down.
- Else if there is a digit on the right side of the current cell, then navigate to right.
- Else stop the navigation.
Finally, the program must print all the navigated characters as the output.

Input:
5 5
p 6 q t =
I z 7 h *
t ) i e t
t e t n s

Output:
p6z7i
