/*The booking status of N seats in a row in a theatre is passed as the input. 'B' indicates the
seats are booked and 'F' indicates the seats are not booked yet. The N seats are divided into
three blocks. The number of seats in each block (X, Y and Z) are passed as the input. A family
with K members want to book continuous seats in a given block. The program must print Yes
if it is possible to book K seats continuously in a single block. Else the program must print No
as the output.
Note: The sum of X, Y and Z is equal to N.

Input:
20 4 12 4
B B F F F F F F B F B B  B F F F F F F B
4

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
The number of seats in a row is 20.
The first 4 seats B, B, F and F are in the first block.
The next 12 seats F, F, F, F, B, F, B, B, B, F, F and F are in the second block.
The next 4 seats F, F, F and B are in the third block.
The second block has the 4 continuous seats which are not booked yet. So Yes is printed as the
output.
