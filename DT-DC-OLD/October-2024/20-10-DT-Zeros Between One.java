/*The program must accept two integers N and K as the input. The program must print YES if
there are at least K zeroes between two every two Is in the binary representation of N. Else
the program must print NO as the output.

Input:
290 2

Output:
YES

Explanation:
Here N = 290 and K = 2.
The binary representation of 290 is 100100010.
There are 2 zeroes present between first two Is.
There are 3 zeroes present between last two Is.
So YES is printed as the output.
