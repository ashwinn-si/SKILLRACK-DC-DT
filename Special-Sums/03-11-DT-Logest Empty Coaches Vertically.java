/*A train consists of R*C coaches. The train is standing on a railway platform which is designed in
a vertical zig-zag fashion. The program must accept an integer matrix of size R*C containing
only I's and O's representing coaches of the train. The top-left cell of the matrix represents the
one of the ends of the train. The integer 1 indicates that the coach is full and O indicates that
the coach is empty. The program must print the length of the longest empty coaches in the
train.
